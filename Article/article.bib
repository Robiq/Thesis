	abstract = {Trust and reputation systems represent a signiﬁcant trend in decision support for Internet mediated service provision. The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reﬂect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative ﬁltering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing and proposed systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation for Internet transactions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this area, and to propose a research agenda for trust and reputation systems.},

	abstract = {Recently, a new standard, WebRTC, has been published, which defines a standardized
mechanism for establishing direct data connections between browsers without the need for
a 3rd party plug-in application. The WebRTC data channel mechanism can be used to send
arbitrary data between browsers. The purpose of the final year project was to study and
describe the protocols and interfaces used to realize WebRTC data channels, and to describe
how to implement applications using WebRTC data channels. As part of the final year
project, demo applications using WebRTC data channels have been implemented, in order
to test whether the mechanism can be used for exchanging time sensitive data and exchanging
large data between browsers. Both the client side and the server side applications were
written using the JavaScript programming language.},

Although WebRTC proposes a security architecture to integrate with federated
Web identity systems, it’s incompatible with those identity protocols that don’t
satisfy WebRTC requirements. To fill this gap, two alternative architectures are
proposed. In addition, a Web-of-Trust model is described to address hierarchical
identity systems’ limitations, and a mirror-presence system is developed that can
locate Web users in real time when they’re moving between websites.},

However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby undermining this redundancy. One approach to preventing these “Sybil attacks” is to have a trusted agency certify identities. This paper shows that, without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and coordination among entities.},

With public key cryptography, PGP first generates a random session key and encrypts the plaintext with this key. The session key along with the ciphertext are then encrypted using the recipient\&\#39;s public key and then forwarded to the recipient. Other features include generating message digests, generating digital signatures, management of personal \&\#39;key rings\&\#39; and distributable public key certificates. It is also designed to work off-line to facilitate e-mail and file encryption, rather than on-line transactions.},
